                    The aircraft leasing fund was launched at a signing held in London on June 23, 2014. The ceremony was hosted by Prince Turki Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,

                  <p>
                    With a targeted size of US$5 billion from a combination of equity and debt, the fund aims to focus exclusively on Airbus aircraft. The objective of the Fund is
                    to achieve a risk-adjusted medium to long-term capital appreciation while generating a quarterly cash dividend to investors. The Fund operates according to
                    Shariah principles and will purchase brand new and second hand Airbus aircraft to be leased to airline companies in the Gulf Cooperation Council and
                    Organization of Islamic Conference member countries.
